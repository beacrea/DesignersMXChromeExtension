# Designers.MX Enhancement Chrome Extension
This chrome extension filters playlists for Spotify, Rdio, and Soundcloud on the website http://designers.mx so users won't have to hover over them individuals to find out.

# Function
Clicking on a service shows all playlists currently loaded that work with it. Matches are highlighted while all others are faded.

Because each page load dones't reapply the filter currently, this makes the most sense when a lot of pages are already loaded, such as using a url like https://designers.mx/mixes?page=50 so a lot of albums will be available to filter.
